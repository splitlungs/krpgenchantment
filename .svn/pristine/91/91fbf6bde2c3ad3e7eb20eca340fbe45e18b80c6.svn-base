This mod aims to add a "Minecraft-like" style of Enchanting system.

Build an Enchanting Table, and apply magical enchantments to your items.

Includes a JSON Recipe system, so you can add your own items as magical reagents to apply any of the included enchantments to any item.

Compatible with KRPG Wands and highly recommended
